# Ramen and Dumpling house Carnegie
    
Ramen and Dumpling House in Carnegie is one of those low-key spots that does what it says on the tin. We got dumplings, xiao long bao, some fried pork bun things, and a bowl of noodles to round it out. All up, it was decent value — not dirt cheap, but nothing outrageous either.

Service was snappy and the place had that classic traditional Chinese restaurant vibe — tiled floor, laminated menus, no music, no nonsense. It wasn’t busy, which meant food came out fast and hot.

No complaints from me, but nothing that stood out either. It’s the kind of place you go to when you want a solid feed and minimal fuss.
