# Noodle & BBQ
    
Noodle and BBQ in Carnegie was… quiet. Like, suspiciously quiet. We were the only ones there, and the vibe matched — zero atmosphere.

We ordered two different noodle dishes but I’m pretty sure we got two bowls of the exact same thing. At $20 each you’d hope they’d at least get the order right. Sadly it was pretty bland as well — just kind of there. I was hungry too so all the more reason for it to taste better.

Probs won’t be coming back.
