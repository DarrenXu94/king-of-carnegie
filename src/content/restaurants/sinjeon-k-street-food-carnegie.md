# SinJeon K-Street Food Carnegie
    
SinJeon K-Street Food in Carnegie came in hot with a whopping 4.8 stars on Google, so I was keen to see what the hype was about. The place was packed when we walked in — always a good sign, right?

Unfortunately, it didn’t quite live up to the hype. I got the lunch deal bibimbap and… it was just kinda meh. Nothing offensive, but the flavour didn’t really land. For the price, I expected a bit more punch (and maybe a few more toppings).

Can’t trust Google reviews anymore
