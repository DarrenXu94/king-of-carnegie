thoughts

- maybe need a different backend/command line script to generate match ups and write ups
  - run script: it asks u
    - name of restaurant
    - date/default to today
    - description
    - match up description?
    - did this new restaurant win -> have to fetch
      - if yes update metadata
      - if no, update prev king win tally
      - add to restaurants db
      - add to matchups db
- website only for viewing
